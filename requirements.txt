------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Final: 44/45

[30/30] FEATURES MEET REQUIREMENTS AND WORK RELIABLY

[4/5] DESIGN IS COHERENT AND CONVENIENT
- Author tags on the home page look similar to genre buttons, so users would probably expect them to filter by author.
- After creating/editing a profile/chapter, users would probably want to see the result as it looks to others.
- Having a profile link available from anywhere, not just the home page, would be convenient.
- When reading one of your own stories, it would be nice to have links to edit/delete it.
- If you have to match author/genre names exactly as you search, you might as well just select them from a list.
- Being able to do partial matches would be nice though (and then a text input makes sense).
- It's not clear to users what to type into the search bar for a length search.
- After doing a search, it would be nice if the search form still showed the criteria.
- It would be nice to have a clear way back the whole list after a search.

[5/5] DATA IS ORGANIZED AND PROTECTED

[5/5] WORK WAS SHARED AND COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stage 3

Features due by 5/10:
 1) Any user can filter stories by useful criteria (author, genre, etc.)
 2) Any user can comment on a story.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stage 2

Features due by 4/30:
 1) A logged-in user can create an author profile.
 2) A logged-in author can edit the information in their profile.
 3) A logged-in author can create a story.
 4) A logged-in author can add a chapter to a story.
 5) A logged-in author can edit chapters.

Feedback:
- Completed 5/5 requirements.
- At the moment the button to create a new story isn't available unless you already have a story.
- Similarly, for some reason I don't see the Edit Profile button unless I have already created a story.
- After POST and PATCH requests, ideally you would end up on a page where you can see that the request succeeded.
- In the chapter selects, can you get rid of the generic "Chapters" option and just have it default to Chapter 1?
- Contemplate merging the view-story and edit-story features onto one page, since there's a lot of overlap between them.
- Contemplate merging some of your CSS files, rather than having a separate one for every HTML page. You may only really need one style.css.
- Obviously you'll want to remove any tabs on the home page that don't end up getting their features implemented.
- The green home-page header seems kind of at odds with the rest of your color scheme.
- It's a little hard to read black text against the dark purple.
- There are some access control issues, not on the front end, but on the back end:
  - It is possible for a logged-in user to post a story under another user's name, because your server is trusting users to tell you who they are.
  - It is possible for any user to create or edit any other user's profile, because your server is trusting users to tell you who they are.
  - There's a race condition in story editing - the find operation isn't guaranteed to finish before the update operation begins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Stage 1

Features due by 4/16:
 1) Home page that lists all stories in some default order.
 2) Story page where you can read a story.
 3) Author page that shows an author's bio and lists all stories written by that author.
 4) Ability to log in and log out.

Sample data you'll probably need to demonstrate these features:
- An authors collection (with a couple of authors).
- A stories collection (with a handful of stories).

Feedback:
- Completed 4/4 requirements.
